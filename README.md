# interview-practice
Here are my answers to some interview questions I've had in the past.

- **best-square-possible**: given an integer n, determine the dimensions in a grid of a rectangle as square as possible that would contain n, wasting at most 2 squares.
- **merge-ordered-arrays**: 1) given 2 ordered arrays, merge them and keep them ordered; 2) given n ordered arrays, merge them and keep them ordered.
- **numerals**: convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.
